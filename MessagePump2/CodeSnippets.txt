Send Message

Talk about how its separated into a service class, constructor is basically the same as before

Paste into MessagePumpService.cs class:
public void SendMessage(string message)
        {
            try
            {
                logger.Debug("Sending message: {0}", message);
                SendMessageRequest request = new SendMessageRequest(QUEUE_URL, message);
                SendMessageResponse response = _client.SendMessage(request);
                logger.Debug("Message sent with status code: {0}", response.HttpStatusCode);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                logger.Error("Send message failed: {0}", ex.ToString());
            }
        }

Talk about request model, response model

Paste into MessagePump.cs main:
service.SendMessage("Hello World");
